## About

ApparentMotionGenerator1 is a tool that **transforms a single still image into an apparent motion video (mp4)!**

Apparent motion is a visual illusion where a sequence of static images, shown in rapid succession, creates the perception of smooth motion **â€”even though nothing is actually moving.** This is the same principle behind animation, film, and optical illusions.
In the example video above, the silver grass appears to drift leftward. In reality, the grass never moves at all! The video is generated by cycling through three versions of the same image:

* Original color

* Embossed version

* Inverted color version

Although the position of the grass remains completely fixed, the rapid alternation of these images tricks the brain into perceiving motion.

This software makes it easy and fun to create your own illusion videos for art, visuals, or simply to enjoy the fascinating quirks of human perception.
